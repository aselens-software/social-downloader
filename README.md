## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (Must be installed and in your system PATH)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (Required for merging video/audio and format conversion)

### Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/socialdownloader.git
   cd socialdownloader
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the application**:
   - The server uses `config.json` for settings and `stats.json` for tracking.
   - Default admin password is `admin` (Change this in `config.json`).

4. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Server will run at `http://localhost:3169` (or next available port).

### Docker Setup

Run Aselens instantly using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Netlify (Frontend Only)
The project includes a `netlify.toml` file for easy frontend deployment.
- **Publish Directory**: `public`
- **API Proxying**: By default, `/api/*` requests are proxied. Update the `netlify.toml` with your actual backend URL.

### Backend Deployment
Since the backend requires `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`, we recommend:
- **Render / Railway / Heroku**: Use a Docker-based deployment (using the included `Dockerfile`).
- **VPS**: Standard Node.js setup with binary dependencies installed.

## 🛡 Security & Privacy

Aselens does not store your data. All media downloads are processed on-the-fly or stored temporarily in a private `downloads` folder which is purged regularly. No metadata or user URLs are permanently logged.
